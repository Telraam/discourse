        <h1>Desktop Font Software End User License Agreement</h1>
<p>Please read this document carefully. We recommend that you print a copy for further reference. </p>
<p>This End User License Agreement (further referred to as the “Agreement”, “EULA,” “License,” “Agreement”, or “License Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and Type Tailors BVBA, doing business under commercial name Type By, with a registered business address at Mechelsesteenweg 25, B-2018, Antwerp, Belgium, with a business registration number BE0894904974 (further referred to “Type Tailors”) and becomes a binding contract between you and Type Tailors BVBA. This Agreement governs the terms of use of the Font Software and the design of the Fonts embodied therein (collectively, “Font Software”), together with any printed materials, media and electronic documentation, updates, add-ons, artworks, web services, mobile services, and any other material that may be associated with the product now or in the future. This Agreement becomes effective (1) when you click on the area marked “I agree to all terms and conditions of the applicable license agreement(s),” or (2) if you are acquiring Font Software on a compressed archive delivered via e-mail attachment, or a delivery on a CD, DVD, or when you open the package in which the font software is contained. If you do not wish to enter into this Agreement, do not purchase, download, install, or access and use the Font Software. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Upon payment in full, Type Tailors will grant you a non-exclusive terminable License to the Font Software that accompanies this EULA. Use of the Font Software is limited to Personal or Internal Business Use only. For the purposes of the License, “Font Software” shall be defined as the design of the Fonts together with the Font Software which, when used generates typeface and typographic designs, symbols, and ornaments. Personal or Internal Business Use shall mean Use of the Font Software for your customary, personal, or internal business purposes and, except as may be otherwise permitted herein, shall not mean the commercial distribution or use of Font Software or any component thereof in any Commercial Product whatsoever. You hereby agree that the Font Software shall further comprise all bitmap and/or outline representations of typeface and typographic designs and ornaments created by or derived from the Font Software. The Font Software shall be deemed to include, if applicable, any upgrades, updates, related files, permitted modifications, permitted copies, and related documentation. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are a design company, advertising agency, consultancy, or if you are purchasing this license for use by, or on behalf of, such an entity, or a third-party End User, the ultimate End User (the client) must also purchase a license appropriate for the intended use of the Font Software. In case when the ultimate client will need or require copies of the Font Software, the ultimate client must also purchase his own License. The license granted herein is strictly for use by the license holder – it does not cover or extend to uses by third parties, including but not limited to freelance or independent contractors, or temporary employees using the Font Software in professional environments or for other professional uses. You may not make more copies of the Font Software than the maximum number your license allows. Under the circumstances when a greater number of licenses is required, you, the employer, and/or the ultimate end user are required to purchase additional licenses appropriate for their usage.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this Agreement, “Commercial Product” shall mean, for example only, not limitation, a user editable electronic document created by use of the Font Software which is then offered for distribution to the public as a Commercial Product in exchange for a separate fee or remuneration. For example only, not limitation, an electronic publication to be distributed for a fee shall be considered a Commercial Product.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Except as may be otherwise prohibited herein, you are permitted to electronically distribute a “Personal or Internal Business Use” document (that is, a document other than a Commercial Product as defined above) (i) that is in a static graphic image (for example, a “gif”) or in an embedded electronic document, and (ii) which is distributed in a format that permits only the viewing and printing (and not the editing, altering, enhancing, modifying or extraction of the Font Software) of such static graphic image or embedded document. Personal or Internal Business Use shall not include any use of the Font Software by persons that are not members of your immediate household, or your authorised employees. All such users shall be notified by you as to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Type Tailors, including its successors and its assigns, do retain all right, title and interest in and to the Font Software together with the design of the Font embodied therein together with any trademarks used in connection therewith. Except where otherwise expressly permitted herein, you agree not to copy the Font Software or create derivative typeface design works and/or font software based upon the design of the Font or the Font Software. You agree that the unauthorised use of the design of the Font and/or the Font Software represents an infringement of Type Tailors’s exclusive rights causing significant monetary harm. You also agree that such damages cannot be readily estimated and Type Tailors shall be entitled to seek a restraining order to prevent any unauthorised uses. In the event of infringement, Type Tailors’s rights and remedies shall be cumulative.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You are not allowed to alter the Font Software or the designs embodied therein in any possible way.

</li>
<li><p>You may make two (2) back-up copies of Font Software for archival purposes only, and you agree to retain exclusive custody and control over any such copy. Upon termination of the Agreement, you must destroy the original and any and all copies of the Font Software. Uploading the Font Software to GitHub repositories is not allowed and represents unauthorised sharing and distribution of the Font Software. The unauthorised sharing, lending, renting, sale, or other unauthorised use or misuse of the back-up copy, represents a material breach of this Agreement and will result in the immediate termination of this License.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>The design of the Font, the Font Software and any trademarks associated therewith are the exclusive property of Type Tailors BVBA and are protected by the copyright and other intellectual property law of Kingdom of Belgium, as well as by the international copyright and design laws and international treaties.</p>

All trademarks shall be used in accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner’s name.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Embedding of the Fonts in a print/preview format is permitted. Notwithstanding, embedding or other use of the Fonts or the outlines thereof in any method which permits the extraction of the Font Software of the designs embodied therein is expressly prohibited.

Under the circumstances when a greater number of licenses is required, you are required to purchase additional licenses appropriate for your usage. You agree that the installation of Font Software on a greater total number of computing devices than the maximum number your license allows - including but not limited to the installation of Font Software on your computing devices via Adobe Creative Cloud - represents an unauthorised use of the Font Software.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Except as may be otherwise expressly provided for herein, you expressly agree not to rent, lease, sublicense, give, lend, donate, or further distribute the Font Software. You may not transfer your rights under this Agreement - fully or in part - to another person or entity at any time.</p>

The terms of this Agreement are contractual in nature.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Consumers only: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, special damages, or implied warranties.

Such rights are determined to be deemed non-waiveable as a matter of law and to supersede the rights or any limitations specifically provided herein. Then such law, statute, treaty, or governmental regulation shall be deemed to be made a part of the Agreement.
