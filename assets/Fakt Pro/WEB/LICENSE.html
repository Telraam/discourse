<p>Please read this document carefully. We recommend that you print a copy for further reference.</p>
<p>This End User License Agreement (further referred to as the “Agreement”, “EULA,” “License,” “Agreement”, or “License Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you and Type Tailors BVBA, doing business under commercial name Type By, with a registered business address at Mechelsesteenweg 25, B-2018, Antwerp, Belgium, with a business registration number BE0894904974 (further referred to “Type Tailors”) and becomes a binding contract between you and Type Tailors BVBA. This Agreement governs the terms of use of the Font Software and the design of the Fonts embodied therein (collectively, “Font Software”), together with any printed materials, media and electronic documentation, updates, add-ons, artworks, web services, mobile services, and any other material that may be associated with the product now or in the future. This Agreement becomes effective (1) when you click on the area marked “I agree to all terms and conditions of the applicable license agreement(s),” or (2) if you are acquiring Font Software on a compressed archive delivered via e-mail attachment, or a delivery on a CD, DVD, or when you open the package in which the font software is contained. If you do not wish to enter into this Agreement, do not purchase, download, install, or access and use the Font Software.</p>

You further agree to exercise reasonable care to avoid unauthorised distribution of the Font Software. If you cannot or do not agree to the terms of this license, do not access or use and, if appropriate, return the software unused to Type Tailors.</p>
